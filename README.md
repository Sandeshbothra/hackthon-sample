This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `docker build . -t <build-name>`

Create the docker image and instructs Docker to ‘tag’ this particular build.

### `docker run -p <host_machine_port>:3000 <build-name>`

After running the previous build command, you can now use the tag name to start a container from this image
